# Machine-Learning-Workshop
It was a introductory Machine Learning Workshop organized by EWU Robotics Club . It gave an introduction to Python  and Pandas . We we did few basic projects like these to get a gist of how ML algorithms work .

these projects are mainly of two types .
1. predicting price of some product or sales . Like for the ice- cream project the proggrame is given a data set that has the sales report of ice cream sales of different days and corresponding temparature of that day . then the programmne finds a pattern from that data and gives a prediction of ice cream sales on a particular day based on the temparature of that day . the price prediction proggrame also works similarly .

2. identifing objects . Both the Miniso Fashon project and Iris flower project serves as an object identifier proggramme . they are feed lots of data containg the details of different objects . After that the proggrame kan identify similar objects with noticible accuracy .
